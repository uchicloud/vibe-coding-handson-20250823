# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python coding exercise repository focused on lambda expressions and functional programming concepts. The project is structured as a hands-on learning environment with specific tasks to implement using one-line lambda expressions.

## Development Commands

- **Run main script**: `python main.py`
- **Work with Jupyter notebooks**: Use `jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook` to open the interactive exercises in `chapter4/`

## Project Structure

- `main.py` - Simple entry point script
- `chapter4/level1.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing lambda expression exercises
- `pyproject.toml` - Python project configuration (minimal setup, no external dependencies)

## Exercise Requirements

When working on exercises in `chapter4/level1.ipynb`:
- All implementations must be one-line lambda expressions
- Tasks are organized into three categories:
  1. Mathematical operations (sum, square, tax calculation)
  2. String manipulations (uppercase, formatting, name restructuring)
  3. Logic operations (even/odd, min/max, grading)
- Solutions should be submitted as test code for verification
- Each task requires both implementation and verification

## Python Environment

- Requires Python >=3.12
- No external dependencies currently defined
- Uses standard library functionality only
